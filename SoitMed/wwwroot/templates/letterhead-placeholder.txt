This file is a placeholder for the letterhead.png file.
To use the company letterhead:
1. Extract the background from the "Letterhead New (3).docx" Word document
2. Convert it to a PNG image
3. Save it as "letterhead.png" in this directory (SoitMed/wwwroot/templates/)
4. The PDF export service will automatically use it as a background

The PDF service will work without it, but with a plain background.
